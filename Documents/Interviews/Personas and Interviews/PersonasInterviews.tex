\itemsep0em 
\item Almost exclusively for her accounting and finance classes
\item Most of her usage of the calculator is for simple lightweight math used in accounting and finance.
\item She does not use it extensively, mostly for exams and homework.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What would you like your calculator to do? Or what is the ideal calculator for you?}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item She likes her calculator to be simple
\item Prefers a calculator that has its function symbols identical to the ones in the books
\item She would like her calculator to display the answers in a human readable form (5x7 Matrix numeric representation), and not the digital form (7-segment numeric representation)
\item In the future she would like to see a calculator network system, similar to that of the iclicker, where the professor would give you a password, which after inputting it into the calculator, downloads a custom function from the professor's base station, or unlocks/locks some of the pre programmed functions in the calculator.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What kinds of calculators have you used? (physical, apps, online, etc.). Hardware or Software?}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item Uses both a physical calculator as well as a calculator app on her phone.
\item Mainly uses the calculator application because it’s always available.

\textbf{Goals and Tasks user accomplishes}\\
Kevin says he just wants to get through his classes and get a decent GPA. Like everyone, his hardest classes mostly have to do with math (although he feels he is better than average). Kevin will be happy with anything that can make his math calculations easier.\\ \\
\textbf{Problem calculator solves} \\
The calculator helps Kevin get fast answers to difficult math problems he sees in class. Without a calculator, he is not sure how he would calculate the various functions that he sees on a daily basis. The calculator has to be precise enough so he can get the right answer to complex solutions of differential equations but he is not willing to wait - calculation must be near-instantaneous.

\subsection*{Interview Q\&A}
\textbf{What do you use a calculator for?}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item University studies
\item Mostly finds himself using it for mathematical purposes. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What would you like your calculator to do? Or what is the ideal calculator for you?}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item His  ideal calculator would not be missing essential functions like plus, minus, multiplication, exponents, and the basics. Other common functions he mentioned from University, include logs, derivatives, e, integrals, roots, square roots, and more. He believes it’s a must to have the ANS (answer button), and calculation history included too. 
\item The calculator should be lightweight and portable. 
\item In the future he would like to see more calculators that provide more support for polar coordinates. Lastly he would like to have access to shorter readable manuals or video content to quickly go over all of the calculator’s features and how to implement them.
\item Believes It would be great to have the answer button, calculation history, polar capability and a shorter readable manual! 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What kinds of calculators have you used? (physical, apps, online, etc.). Hardware or Software?}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item Both softwares and physical.
\item Prefers physical calculator more than software-based because he has become used to it since his High School years. 
\item He doesn’t mind using software calculators as long as it has useful shortcuts. He defined a simple software calculator as something that can open and run quickly on a computer or any other device. 
\item Kevin also mentioned he uses software calculators mostly for basic problems but not derivations and more advanced operations because it becomes too tedious to work with. He would much rather use the physical one. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What functions do you use most often? Which ones do you use the least?}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, roots, converting to fractions, sin, cos, tan, exponents, logs, and mod.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What features did you like most about your calculator. What do you not like about your calculator?}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item He liked Hexadecimal conversion, octa, binary conversions, derivations, and integration functions because they’re relevant to his engineering courses. .
\item Kevin doesn’t like using the mouse pointer on his computer to input the values and functions on his software-based calculator. He would much rather use the computer keyboard. He mentioned the clicking option should be removed completely to encourage others to use the keyboard. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Are the aesthetics of your calculator important? What matters most (shape, color,  personalized themes, etc.)?}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item Easy to fit in your palm, portable, not too colourful (greyish, black). It should also be key mappable if it is a software-based calculator.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{If you’re using a keyboard, how would you map the keys to functions, numbers, etc. ergonomics?}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item He would use the numbered keypad for inputting numbers 
\item Any symbols that are already commonly found (+,-,\^,etc.) on both computers and physical calculators should be included.
\item Assign important features and functions to large buttons, like the space bar or return key.
\item Include a shortcut to quit
\item Use the first letter of functions to input them into calculator. Ex: C for cos, S for sin, T for Tan, etc.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Thoughts on making a calculator that has customizable capabilities? }
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item Doesn’t think it is necessary. He usually uses google to help solve complex problems and inputs the simple calculations on the calculator to double check his work and find the final answer. 
\item He believes it would be great to include physical skins to personalize the calculator but it is not a must.
\item In the future he would like to make it customizable by being able to download packages for calculator functions that can easily be added or removed to the device.
