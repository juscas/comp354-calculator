\subsection{Requirements gathering}

In order to create software requirements, our team got together to brainstorm ideas for what features the calculator would have and how to implement them. We made sure our features were realistic, keeping in mind the time constraint of the project and the development experience of the team. Once we had a base for how we thought our calculator could be developed, we decided to conduct interviews on potential users to find out what features everyday users of calculators actually valued and if our initial ideas complemented these. \\

From the answers from our interviewees, we created user personas that had concrete problems and tasks that needed to be completed and that our software would solve. The user personas along with our initial discussions would then inform what different use cases might be for our calculator. The use cases were put into a standard use case diagram so that the high-level design of the calculator could be understood at a glance. Each use case was then expanded in a summary use case description.
