\subsection{Exclusions}

The following features were discussed and rejected for reasons that are documented in brief in the following table.

\begin{tabular}[!h]{|p{3.5cm} | p{10cm}|}
\hline 
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Reason} \\ 
\hline 
Distributed on web & No one has web skills. Everyone knows Java. \\ 
\hline
User customizations & We are not able to determine the workload that this represents since we are not far in the development of the calculator - TBD.  \\ 
\hline
Mobile & Team does not have the skills to do that. \\
\hline
Hyperbolic functions & We don't even know what they are. The engineering interviewees never really used them except for \"that one class\". We don't think they are worth the effort. \\
\hline
Distributed on web & No one has web skills. Everyone knows Java. \\ 
\hline
Animations & No one has any skills with that. This will be the first GUI for some of us. \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular} 
\medskip

When looking at the reasons for our exclusions we clearly see that our incompetence is a key factor in what tasks we are willing to take on. \\

Motivation with regards to accepting new features is lukewarm. Some team members are not particularly enthused about having to make a calculator. They would have preferred to have made a game (or anything else, actually). We are managing this by concentrating on the deliverables and focusing on the key features that the interviewees brought up.
