*Description : Eternity Calculator is a calculator that 
               supports many mathematical functions while
               maintaining a simple and elegant look. Along 
               with its simple looks, Eternity has a range 
               of useful features, all of which will be 
               mentioned below.

*Requirements : 

    - Java 8 or lower

*Features : 

    (1) Support for Natural Language : (cos(2)^sqrt(2))

    (2) Assign constants : 
	- ex : a = 34
	- reserved letters : e (Eulers' number) , p (pi)
	- letters must be in lower case


    (2) Support for multiple themes (Dark/Light)

    (4) Error messages with feedback

(1) Supported Functions and Syntax 

    ( Capital words refer to user input )

      -Logarithm base 10 : log(N)

      -Logarithm with user defined base : log(B,N)

      -Linear logarithm : ln(N)

      -nth Root of a number: root(BASE,EXPONENT)

      -Square root : sqrt(N)

      -Cosine : cos(N)

      -Sine : sin(N)

      -Secant : sec(N)

      -Cosecant : csc(N)

      -Cotangent : cot(N)

      -e to the X : e^N

      -Power : N^X

      -Factorial : fact(N) Where N is an Integer

(2) Assigning constants 
      
      Alphabetical constants are assigned by typing a letter

      followed by an '=' sign and the value you wish to assign 

      to it.

      Note : (1) alphabetical constants must be in lower case

             (2) e and p are reserved characters fo Eulers' 
   
                 number and pi

(3) Changing Themes
    
      To changes theme, go to the Themes button in the top 

      menu bar, and select which theme you wish to use.
